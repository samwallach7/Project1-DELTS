# Project1-DELTS & NHL


Hockey is one of the most popular sports in North America. The National Hockey League (NHL) was founded in 1917 and has experienced significant growth and transformation over the years. The NHL has experienced many ups and downs but its most notorious years were from the 1980's to 2010, which included winning the Olympics to almost going bankrupt and then experiencing a resurgence in popularity. How did Hockey evolve over the course of those 3 decades? Did player performance aid in the renaissance in hockey? Did winning the Olympics cause players to be more competitive? Did the downturn force players to perform better?
